MBTI test results are quite amusing to read. I've taken the test multiple times over the years and have been typed as an INTP. Although, MBTI does not have sufficient scientific validity, I get amazed at many of the uncanny similarities I have with the INTP. Besides, being typed as the same personality type as the likes of Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin and Immanuel Kant serves as a nice ego boost. Recently, I have been trying to better understand myself and decided to read the book "The INTP: Personality, Careers, Relationships, & the Quest for Truth and Meaning". I wanted to share some of key takeaways of the book and commonalities I found with the INTP personality. 

The four main functions of the INTP from most dominant to least dominant are:

**Introverted Thinking** - works to develop an internal framework of the world that makes sense logically.

**Extraverted Intuition** - works to generate possibilities and abstract connections from the world around.

**Introverted Sensing** - works to use past experiences to compare with the present and recognize changes and inconsistencies. 

**Extraverted Feeling** - harmony seeking and sensitive to the emotions and moods of others.

INTPs are philosophical thinkers who enjoying theorizing and understanding the underlying nature of things. Due to their extraverted intuition and feeling functions, they carry a charm and appear approachable. When a topic interests them, they can be great conversationists. INTPs do not like rules or being told what to do. INTPs love autonomy and the book coins them as the most independent of all personality types. 

INTPs signature strengths are creativity and ingenuity. They perform well in careers that exercise their intellect and need for autonomy. Some examples of pursuits INTPs may excel in are professions related to computer systems, writing, and entrepreneurship. 

Due to their constant desire for independence, they can often neglect interpersonal affairs. But once their extraverted feeling is developed, they seek out human connections to feed this function. INTPs seek a "mindmate" in relationships. They wish to be in a relationship for the genuine love and appreciation for their partner's mind and ideas. 

Emotionally, INTPs are childlike and naive. They are often detached from their internal emotional state and are not the best at communicating their emotional needs. INTPs have a difficult time dealing with negative emotions of others and can deal with them in unproductive means such as avoidance or lashing out. Nonetheless, due to their extraverted feeling function, INTPs can be empathetic personalties. The book distinguishes the INTP's form of empathy as cognitive rather than affective. They are good at reading the feelings and thoughts of others but not necessarily feeling what others feel. 

INTPs are constantly searching for meaningful truths and can suffer from bouts of feelings of meaninglessness when unable to find such truths. INTPs find satisfaction once they realize that it's not the truth that gives them meaning but rather it is the seeking of truth that is meaningful.

The book suggests that INTPs may find it helpful to develop a philosophy along the lines of: “Regardless of what happens, I will be okay”. I found that quite relatable as means of coping with the unanticipated distress of life.

Early on in their childhood, the INTP focuses on developing their introverted thinking. This makes them goal-oriented and striving for excellence in whatever interests them. As they grow, they develop their extraverted intuition which makes them great ideators and they devote more attention to the extraverted feeling function. Due to their vivid imagination, the extraverted feeling manifests in them by escaping reality to indulge in romantic feelings. Extraverted feeling also makes them seek affirmation from others. Young INTPs show an ego-driven desire for greatness and recognition in life. They can get depressed when the idealistic visions of their careers or relationships fail. As INTPs mature, they let go of their need for ego-driven pursuits and savour being present in each new moment. This psychologically maturity enables them to approach new things for their intrinsic value rather than a need for success.

And that's the INTP, the most independent and philosophical of the Myers Briggs personality types.
