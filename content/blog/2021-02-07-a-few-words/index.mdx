```
When I close my eyes, I see you
Running to me in my dreams
Eternity passed, as I waited for you
Nothing has been so worthy it seems

I reminisce the time I had dinner with you
Hearing your angry words, I felt my body freeze
But I couldn't stop admiring you
Because you are the bees knees

I gaze into sunsets, searching away
Hoping to someday find you
I sit in McDonald's, munching away
Hoping to find the feeling, I found with you

I wanna do art like that someday
And now I wanna paint my heart away
I wanna be the canvas to your paintbrush one day
Because I want you to paint my world away

Months pass, pondering away
I'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away
Waiting to hear from another dreamer
So we could dream away

I'm no poet but I could rhyme a few words for you
Because I can't keep it in me no more
I wanna hear you sing a song everyday
So will you hear my plea and set me free?
```
